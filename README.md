# React + Vite
Project Overview:

This project is a React-based e-commerce web application featuring a variety of essential components for an online store. The application is built with a focus on user experience, state management using Redux, and routing via react-router-dom.

Key Components:
Admin.jsx:
Manages the product inventory, allowing for adding, editing, and removing products.
Provides a backend interface for administrative tasks, which may include managing user roles and monitoring sales.
Cart.jsx:
Manages the shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add products, update quantities, and remove items from the cart.
Handles order confirmation, where orders are added to the order history and the cart is cleared.
Footer.jsx:
Displays the footer section across the website, including contact information and an "About Us" section.
Ensures consistent branding and provides users with important links and information.
Header.jsx:
Provides the navigation bar with links to different pages, such as Home, Cart, and Order History.
Includes a responsive design with a toggleable menu and a shopping cart icon showing the number of items in the cart.
Home.jsx:
Serves as the landing page of the application, showcasing featured products and categories.
Engages users with promotions and highlighted items, encouraging them to explore the product catalog.
Login.jsx:
Manages user authentication, providing forms for logging in and registering new accounts.
Ensures that only authenticated users can access certain features, such as order history and cart checkout.
OrderHistory.jsx:
Displays a history of all orders made by the user, including details like the order ID, date, and items purchased.
Allows users to review their past purchases, enhancing customer experience and trust.
ProductCard.jsx:
Represents individual product items with details like name, price, and an image.
Includes functionality for adding products to the cart directly from the product listing.
ProductList.jsx:
Renders a list of all available products in a grid format.
Utilizes the ProductCard component to display each product and allows for dynamic loading of products from the Redux store.
Technologies Used:
React for building the user interface.
Redux for managing the application state, particularly for the cart and product inventory.
React Router for navigation between different pages.
FontAwesome for icons used in various components like the header and footer.
This project demonstrates a solid foundation for an e-commerce application, with a focus on modularity, state management, and user interface design.



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
